        <h1>Thank You for Visiting!</h1>
        <p>
          Hey there! <br />I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for spending some time exploring my Scrum Board
          project. What started as a straightforward addition to my GitHub portfolio turned into a rewarding challenge
          that allowed me to experiment, learn, and grow as a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Scrum Board you see here is a reflection of my journey with React, JavaScript, TypeScript, and exploring
          the magic of local storage for managing data. By keeping things simple and avoiding APIs this time, I was able
          to focus on creating a functional, user-friendly tool for organizing tasks and workflows.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this project might not grow into a full-fledged product, itâ€™s an important milestone in my learning path
          and a stepping stone toward building more ambitious applications. My ultimate goal is to keep honing my
          skills, learning from every project, and sharing my ideas with the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you found this Scrum Board useful, inspiring, or just a neat little tool, Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts or
          even just know you stopped by! Feel free to connect with me or check out the rest of my portfolio on GitHub
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you again for your time, your curiosity, and for being part of this small chapter in my developer
          journey. It means a lot! ðŸ¥° <br />
          Warm regards, <br /> <br />
