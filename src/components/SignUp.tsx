        Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ <br />
        Originally, this page was meant for user sign-upsâ€”but I decided to keep things simple this time and stick to
        local storage for managing your Scrum Board data. No APIs, no fuss! ðŸ˜…
      </p>
      <p>
        While thereâ€™s no sign-up functionality here, the Scrum Board is fully functional and ready for action. Feel free
        to dive in, create tasks, and organize your workflowâ€”everything will be saved right here in your browser. <br />
        Thanks for stopping by, and happy sprinting! ðŸš€
      </p>
